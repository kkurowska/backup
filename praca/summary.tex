\chapter{Summary}

\textit{** Wavelets can be really useful in data mining tasks. Edge detection algorithm was developed, as an example of usage wavelets in dimensionality reduction in pre-processing of machine learning. There are parameters like threshold and type of wavelet, which enable flexibility of the algorithm. The application in analysing biomedical images **}
