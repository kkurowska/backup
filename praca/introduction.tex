\chapter*{Introduction}

\textit{ ** Few words about my thesis...
Generally what is a data mining, what are the wavelets, what are the applications in data mining and finally, what is the main purpose - edge detection. **}

Data mining is connected with computing huge amount of data, thus to analyse those data it is require to use algorithms with low computational complexity. Wavelet transform is very efficient.

%\textit{ Real world data sets are usually not directly suitable for performing Data
%Mining algorithms. They contain noise, missing values and may be inconsistent.
%In addition, real world data sets tend to be too large and high-dimensional.
%Wavelets provide a way to estimate the underlying function from the data. With
%the vanishing moment property of wavelets, we know that only some wavelet
%coefficients are significant in most cases. By retaining selective wavelet coefficients,
%wavelet transform could then be applied to denoising and dimensionality
%reduction. Moreover, since wavelet coefficients are generally decorrelated,
%we could transform the original data into wavelet domain and then carry out
%Data Mining tasks.}

In today world more and more times we are operating on data that tend to be big and high-dimensional.
In addiction most of them can be really messy. Missing values, noises or inconsistent data are only few of the problems we have to face. That is why working with Data Mining algorithms are often difficult or even impossible. 
At this point wavelets are usually the solution. Thanks to their properties we are able to underlying function from the data.
Then Data Mining tasks are way easier to carry out. 
But how it is done? Every wavelet consists with many different wavelet coefficients.
We can specify, thanks to vanishing moment property, which of wavelet coefficients are significant in our case.
Knowing this we can perform wavelet transform which makes our data more less noisy and dimensional reduced.
It is possible because wavelet coefficients are generally decorrelated.

%Pre-processing:
%
%Denoising signals and images. Wavelet denoising - transform data into wavelet domain, remove noise components (with lower frequency) and then back to the original domain.
%
%Data Transformation?
%
%Dimensionality reduction. The idea is to simplify data, by getting rid off the less relevant information. In a wavelet domain we retain only the largest coefficients. Then, after getting back to the original domain we obtain simplified data.
%
%Machine learning processing:
%
%Clustering. Low frequency parts are correlated with regions of objects concentration and the high frequency parts correspond to the areas with sudden changes in the objects distribution. Thus, clustering can be conducted by recognising correlated components in the wavelet domain.
